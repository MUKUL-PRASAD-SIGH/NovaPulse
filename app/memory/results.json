          "title": "RIL, Jio to pump Rs 10 lakh cr to make AI affordable: Ambani",
          "content": "Reliance Industries (RIL) and Jio will invest Rs 10 lakh crore over seven years as the conglomerate looks to play a major role in India\u2019s AI transformation and make AI affordable and accessible for citizens, RIL Chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani said on Thursday. According to Ambani, after connecting \u201cIndia to the Internet era\u201d, Jio will connect the country to the \u201cintelligence era\u201d by reducing the cost as \u201cdramatically\u201d as the company did for mobile and internet data earlier. At the India AI Impact Summit, he announced Jio Intelligence\u2014RIL\u2019s AI-focussed arm\u2014will build India\u2019s sovereign compute infrastructure, and the conglomerate will partner with best tech companies globally not as importers of AI, but as \u201cco-architects of a new AI century\u201d. On the investment announcement, he said, \u201cThis is not speculative investment. It is not for chasing valuation. This is a patient, disciplined, nation-building capital, designed to create durable economic value and strategic resilience for six decades to come,\u201d he said. Likening AI to Akshaya Patra, Ambani said it offers limitless augmentation in knowledge, efficiency, and productivity. A central question around AI today, he said, is whether it will concentrate power in the hands of a few or will it democratise opportunity for all, and added that India believes in the latter\u2014a future where AI is \u201cavailable, affordable, and beneficial to all\u201d. He also said that success of the AI movement globally hinges critically on cooperation and sharing \u201cbe it chips or rare earths\u201d and not hoarding, and that India has a unique strength in that context as it serves as a \u201cvital bridge\u201d between the Global South and Global North. Ambani asserted India will emerge as \u201cone of the greatest AI powers\u201d in this century as no other country can match its strength in \u201cdemography, democracy, development, digital infrastructure, data generation, and AI harvest\u201d. Emphasising that Jio will deliver AI to Indians at highly affordable prices, Ambani said, \u201c\u2026 Jio will do so with the same reliability, quality, scale, and extreme affordability that transformed connectivity. India cannot afford to rent intelligence. Therefore, we will reduce the cost of intelligence as dramatically as we did the cost of data.\u201d Ambani said Jio Intelligence will build India\u2019s sovereign compute infrastructure through \u201cthree bold initiatives\u201d\u2014 gigawatt-scale data centres, ready green power surplus, and a nationwide edge compute. \u201cWe have already started construction on multi-gigawatt, AI-ready data-centres at Jamnagar. Over 120 MW will come online in the second half of 2026 this year, and a clear path to gigawatt-scale compute for training and large-scale inference\u2026 We have an in-house energy advantage with up to 10 GW of ready green-power surplus, anchored by solar in both Kutch and Andhra Pradesh,\u201d Ambani said. \u201cAn edge-compute layer, deeply integrated with Jio\u2019s network, will make intelligence responsive, low-latency and affordable \u2014 close to where Indians live, learn and work\u2026 Our resolve is clear: make intelligence as ubiquitous as connectivity,\u201d he added. The RIL chairman said Jio Intelligence is guided by five \u201cnon-negotiable principles\u201d, including a commitment to multilingual AI capability across all Indian languages and a promise that AI will create new high-skilled work opportunities rather than displacing jobs. The other principles include making AI accessible to agriculture and informal sectors, and small businesses, keeping \u201cresponsibility, security, data residency, and trust as Jio\u2019s core guarantees\u201d, and building a deep partnership ecosystem with Indian enterprises, startups, and top technology and research institutes.
